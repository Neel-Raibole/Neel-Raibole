<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Data Science Projects:</h2>

- <b>PlotTwist(Automated Chart Interpretation and Summarization Pipeline)</b>
  - [PlotTwist](https://github.com/Neel-Raibole/PlotTwist)
  - <b>Overview: </b>This project presents an end-to-end automated pipeline for interpreting and summarizing visual data from Pie, Bar, and Line charts. The system integrates computer vision, OCR, and NLP techniques to detect chart elements using YOLOv11, extract textual and numerical data with PaddleOCR, and generate natural language summaries. It supports various chart formats by handling annotations, legends, and axis labels, and incorporates super-resolution, denoising, and thresholding for enhanced accuracy. The project is designed for scalable deployment and has applications in automating data reporting and accessibility.
- <b>Abstractive Text Summarization using ProphetNet with LoRA Fine-Tuning</b>
  - [Abstractive Text Summarization using ProphetNet with LoRA Fine-Tuning](https://github.com/Neel-Raibole/Abstractive-Text-Summarization-using-ProphetNet-with-LoRA-Fine-Tuning)
  - <b>Overview: </b>This project focuses on abstractive text summarization using ProphetNet, a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture designed to improve sequence-to-sequence generation. To make fine-tuning more efficient and lightweight, LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) was integrated, enabling parameter-efficient updates without retraining the full model. Post fine-tuning, the model was evaluated using ROUGE metrics, achieving solid performance on the test set. This repository includes the full training pipeline, evaluation workflow, and loss analysis offering a reproducible and scalable solution for low-resource summarization tasks.
- <b>Sentiment Analysis for YELP Dataset using Bi-LSTM & DistilBERT</b>
  - [Sentiment Analysis for YELP Dataset using Bi-LSTM & DistilBERT](https://github.com/Neel-Raibole/Sentiment-Analysis-using-BiLSTM-and-Transformer)
  - <b>Overview: </b>A comparative sentiment analysis project on the Yelp 2018 dataset using BiLSTM and DistilBERT. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, model training, fine-tuning with Optuna, and evaluation on multiclass sentiment labels (positive, neutral, negative). Both models were optimized for performance, and LIME was used to interpret predictions, providing a balance of accuracy and explainability in NLP sentiment classification.

<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Data Analytics Projects:</h2>

- <b>Supply Chain Analysis Dashboard</b> <br />
  - [Supply Chain Dashboard](https://github.com/Neel-Raibole/Supply-Chain-Dashboard) <br />
  - <b>Overview: </b>An end-to-end, interactive dashboard that unifies transactional order data and monthly inventory snapshots to deliver real-time visibility into sales performance, customer behavior, and fulfillment efficiency. With a 6-month rolling analysis window, it highlights geographic concentration, schedule adherence, and forecast accuracy, empowering Supply Chain, Sales, and Operations leaders to preemptively address stock imbalances, streamline logistics, and align purchasing with true demand.

- <b>Sales Analysis Dashboard</b> <br />
   - [Sales Analysis Dashboard](https://github.com/Neel-Raibole/Sales-Analysis-Dashboard) <br />
  - <b>Overview: </b>A high-impact, star-schema‚Äìdriven dashboard designed for TechWorks USA to track Revenue, Profit, Orders, Returns, and Customer Activity across the U.S. over a rolling 6-month period. It surfaces coastal market dependencies, seasonal sales volatility, product-line profitability gaps, and return hotspots providing Sales, Product, Marketing, and Acquisition teams with the insights needed to diversify markets, optimize pricing/promotions, and refine customer acquisition strategies.
